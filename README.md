===============

The IoT SIG project to monitor office environmental data. See the [wiki page](https://github.com/DiUS/comfort-o-meter/wiki) for setup details.

Ideas for improvement
---------------------
* Find out the daily actual local atmospheric pressure at sea level and use that to get a more accurate reading of altitude.
* Use Protocol Buffers (or similar header-based cross-platform message definition mechanism) to encode and decode the message over ZigBee more efficiently.
